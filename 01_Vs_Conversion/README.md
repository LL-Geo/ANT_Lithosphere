# Vs_Conversion
Build a Vs to density and Temperture relaitonship using a modified version(BANCAL22_Mg)of BANCAL22 (https://github.com/JamesHazzard/BANCAL22 by James Hazzard (j.hazzard20@imperial.ac.uk))
Two run are shown in here:
	BANCAL22_Mg_fitting_T: Fitting Temperture for mantle adiabat
	BANCAL22_Mg_fitting_Vs: Fitting Vs for mantle adiabat
Vs_to_den contains code to convert Vs to density and temperture using the MPA from BANCAL22_Mg_fitting_T

Model data is uploaded into a separate zenodo repository (due to the size limitation of Github)
